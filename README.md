 ## about
  Pythomon is a simple pokémon battle simulator and encyclopedia. It is also my first ever Python app!

  This is a desktop GUI application made with Tkinter, CustomTkinter, Pillow, NumPy and Pyglet.

  The player will build their Pokémon team and manage their available moves, while they battle through ever harder stages.

  There is also a "hardcore mode", in which fainted Pokémon are permanently removed from the player's party. WATCH OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  Finally, the Pokédex mode showcases every Pokémon included in the game, along with their stats and moves. I think it looks pretty neat.

 ## goals
  This project started as my first attempt to learn Python (and programming in general). Because I was learning as I was making it, the code is very poorly organized, and all the corners are extremely cut. Still, I'm proud to have managed to finish it to the extent I did.

  Even though this is a very simple game-like software, I consider this project a success. I really did learn a lot, and also became more familiar with software development and programming practices. As someone who literally knew nothing about coding when I first hit "New Project" in PyCharm, I'm satisfied with this result. 

 ## wtf? this code sucks!!!
  Yes. As I said, I was literally learning about Python AS I was working on this, so there really isn't any real structure to the code or planning for the project. I "made it up as I went along" like George Lucas did while directing the Star Wars prequels.

  Some early screenshots:

  I, of course, thought about reworking this into a cleaner, more refined app, but I decided phythomon has served its purpose and that I'm ready to move on to the next step in my journey
  
 ## lessons learned
  Besides learning Python itself, the most important takeaway was learning the importance of planning out the project BEFORE you start coding it (lol). Despite this being kind of obvious, I really got to feel consequences first-hand in the later stages of development. It was great!!!
